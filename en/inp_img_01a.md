# Graphic Button Alt Text Check

## Description

The "Graphic Button Alt Text Check" evaluates whether all <code>&lt;input type="image"&gt;</code> elements on the page have a non-empty, descriptive <code>alt</code> attribute, which serves as the accessible label for users relying on screen readers or keyboard navigation.

## Example outcome

I noticed that <mark>all</mark> the graphic buttons on the page make use of the <code>alt</code> attribute.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen reader will announce the image as “button” without meaning.
- **Motor Impairments:** Button cannot be located or targeted via assistive tools.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Users may not understand button function due to lack of clarity.

## Fixes

To address graphic buttons missing alternative text:

1. Locate the <code>&lt;input type="image"&gt;</code> element missing an alternative text.
2. Add a descriptive <code>alt</code> text, providing information about the action performed by a click.
