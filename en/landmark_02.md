# Inappropriate Banner Landmark Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Banner Landmark Check" evaluates whether the <code>banner</code> landmark is nested in another region's landmark.

## Example outcome

I noticed that the <code>banner</code> landmark <mark>is</mark> contained within other landmark.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen reader users may not recognize or access the banner as expected. It could be skipped or misinterpreted.
- **Motor Impairments:** Improper structure can interrupt keyboard-only navigation, increasing the number of actions needed to reach site-wide navigation or branding.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Incorrect landmark nesting can lead to confusion and poor page comprehension.

## Fixes

To address <code>banner</code> landmarks inappropriately contained within other landmarks:

1. Locate the inappropriately placed <code>banner</code> landmark.
2. Removing it from the other landmark region, and place it on top of the page.
