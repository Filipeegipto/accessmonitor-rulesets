# Letter Spacing Check

## Description

The "Letter Spacing Check" evaluates whether all content does not use CSS or other techniques to prevent users from adjusting text spacing, particularly letter spacing.

## Example outcome

I observed that styles are not used to prevent increasing letter spacing.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Custom spacing helps users distinguish words and letters more clearly.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Improved spacing reduces visual clutter and makes reading less overwhelming.
- **Dyslexia:** Increased letter spacing can help reduce the visual crowding effect, improving character recognition and reading speed.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate letter spacing:

1. Locate the style code used to inappropriately forbid increasing letter spacing.
2. Remove or change the code, ensuring that it allows the increase of letter spacing.
