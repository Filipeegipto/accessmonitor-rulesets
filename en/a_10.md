# Links Accessible Name Check

## Description

The "Links Accessible Name Check" evaluates whether all links on the page have accessible names — meaning every <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element contains descriptive text or has an accessible label (e.g., <code>aria-label</code>, <code>aria-labelledby</code>, or meaningful inner text).

## Example outcome

I noticed that <mark>all links</mark> have an accessible name.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers cannot interpret where a link leads if it lacks a name, making navigation confusing or impossible.
- **Motor Impairments:** A link without a label provides no clue about its function, especially when navigating through a list of focusable elements.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Users with cognitive disabilities may struggle to infer meaning from context and rely on clear, descriptive labels to understand actions.

## Fixes

To address missing or inadequate links accessible name:

1. Find the link without accessible or with an inadequate one.
2. Use a descriptive link text.
3. If using icons or empty links, add <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code>.
4. Avoid using non-descriptive text like “click here” or “read more” without context.
