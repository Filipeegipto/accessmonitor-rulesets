# Inappropriate Measurement Unit Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Measurement Unit Check" evaluates whether there is any usage of fixed units (e.g., <code>px</code>) for defining the width of text containers.

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> instance in the CSS where <code>px</code> measurement unit is used to define the width of text boxes.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Visually impaired users often zoom in up to 200% to read comfortably. Fixed-width containers break layout or cause text to overflow, clip, or be hidden.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Disruption of content flow or overlapping elements can cause confusion and reduce comprehension. Layouts that donâ€™t adapt cause additional mental processing effort.
- **Mobile:** On small screens, fixed widths prevent responsive reflow, making content unreadable or requiring excessive horizontal scrolling.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate measurement units:

1. Locate the CSS code where the fixed unit is used.
2. Replace the fixed unit by a relative one (e.g., <code>%</code>)
