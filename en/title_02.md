# Missing Page Title Check

## Description

The "Missing Page Title Check" evaluates whether the webpage contains no <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element as opposed to the supposed one.

## Example outcome

I noticed that this webpage <mark>does not have a title</mark> - it is missing the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** The title is typically the first thing announced by assistive tech.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Page titles help maintain orientation, especially in multitasking or tab-heavy environments.
- **All:** Browsers display the title in tabs, bookmarks, and history.

## Fixes

To address missing <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> elements:

1. Locate the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.
2. Add a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> with meaningful and descriptive text.
