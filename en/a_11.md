# Missing Links Accessible Name Check

## Description

The "Links Accessible Name Check" evaluates whether there is any anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) element without an accessible name.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> link without accessible name.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers rely on accessible names to announce what a link does. If a link is unnamed, users hear things like "link" with no context, making navigation frustrating or unusable.
- **Motor Impairments:** Tabbing through links without labels provides no context, which makes keyboard navigation disorienting and inefficient.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Users with memory, attention, or processing limitations benefit from clearly labeled actions. Undescriptive or missing labels increase cognitive load and confusion.

## Fixes

To address missing links accessible name:

1. Identify the links with no accessible name.
2. Add a descriptive link text.
3. If it is an icon-only link, add an aria label to it.
4. If it has an image inside the link, use alternative text or aria label.
