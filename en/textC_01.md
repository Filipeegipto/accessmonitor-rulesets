# Text Color Contrast Check

## Description

The "Text Color Contrast Check" evaluates whether all foreground / background text color combinations on the page meet or exceed the enhanced contrast thresholds defined by WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.6 (AAA).

## Example outcome

I observed that <mark>all</mark> color combinations have a contrast ratio above the optimized contrast ratio suggested by the WCAG, which is 4.5 to 1 for larger font text and 7 to 1 for regular font text.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Insufficient contrast can make text unreadable, especially on light or patterned backgrounds.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Low-contrast text increases mental fatigue and strain when reading.
- **Color Blindness:** Certain color pairings (e.g., red/green, blue/purple) may become indistinguishable.
- **Elderly:** Age-related contrast sensitivity reduction can make even mildly low-contrast text difficult to read.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate text and background color contrast ratio:

1. Locate the inappropriate text.
2. Update the color of the element to enhance the contrast against the background.
