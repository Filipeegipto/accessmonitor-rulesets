# Inappropriate Role Value Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Role Value Check" evaluates whether there is any invalid <code>role</code> attribute value on HTML elements.

## Example outcome

I located <mark>1</mark> <code>role</code> attribute with invalid values.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Elements with invalid roles are ignored or misidentified, affecting context or navigation.
- **Motor Impairments:** Missed landmarks (e.g., <code>main</code>, <code>navigation</code>) break expected keyboard shortcuts.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Misleading or missing roles reduce clarity of structure and purpose.

## Fixes

To address <code>role</code> attributes with invalid values:

1. Locate the element where the <code>role</code> attribute has an invalid value.
2. Replace its value with a valid one that suits its purpose, according to WAI-ARIA's specification.
