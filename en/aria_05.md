# Permmitted ARIA State and Property Check

## Description

The "Permmitted ARIA State and Property Check" evaluates whether all ARIA states and properties used in the markup are allowed for the roles or elements they are applied to.

## Example outcome

I noticed that <mark>all</mark> ARIA states and properties are allowed.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** ARIA attributes applied to the wrong role may be ignored by screen readers, meaning critical state info (e.g., expanded, required) is lost.
- **Motor Impairments:** A misrepresented UI can block interactions or cause unexpected behavior with AT software that parses ARIA for focus/order/state info, preventing keyboard users from reaching it.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Missed or broken semantic cues can confuse users who depend on accessible structure or dynamic state updates.

## Fixes

To address not permitted aria state and propery values:

1. Locate the ARIA attribute(s) applied to disallowed roles or elements.
2. Consult the ARIA spec or mapping tables to see which roles the attribute is permitted on.
3. Remove or relocate the ARIA attribute to a compatible role or use a native HTML element that supports the desired behavior.
