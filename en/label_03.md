# Accessible Name Mismatches Visible Label Check

## Description

The "Accessible Name Mismatches Visible Label Check" evaluates whether there is any interactive element that does not contain the visible label text in its accessible name.

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> interactive element which does not have its visible label text in its accessible name.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Hear an element labeled differently than what they visually see, leading to confusion or incorrect assumptions.
- **Motor Impairments:** Commands like “Click ‘Save’” won't work if the accessible name is “Submit Form” while the button says “Save.”
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Inconsistent labels increase cognitive load, making interaction less predictable and more error-prone.

## Fixes

To address interactive elements whose accessible names don't match the visible label:

1. Locate the incorrect interactive element.
2. Change its accessible name to match totally or contain the visible label.
