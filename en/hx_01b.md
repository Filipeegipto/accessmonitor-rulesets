# Inappropriate Headings Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Headings Check" evaluates whether the number of headings on a page is sufficient to represent the pageâ€™s content structure. 

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> heading on the page.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen reader users may struggle to understand the page's layout or jump to key sections without multiple semantic headings.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users relying on keyboard shortcuts to jump between headings will have only one anchor point, making navigation inefficient.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** A single heading may not break the content into manageable parts, leading to confusion or overwhelm.
- **Neurodivergent Disorders:** Poorly segmented content increases mental effort and reduces readability for users with ADHD or processing difficulties.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate headings:

1. Review the page content to determine natural divisions (e.g., different sections).
2. Create a heading for each of the divisions you managed to identify.
3. Ensure a clear and hierarchical use of heading levels.
