# Inappropriate Main Landmark Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Main Landmark Check" evaluates whether there is any <code>main</code> landmark nested within another region's landmark.

## Example outcome

I noticed that the <code>main</code> landmark <mark>is</mark> contained within other landmark.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may skip or misidentify the main content, making it harder to understand the page structure.
- **Motor Impairments:** Landmark navigation (like jumping to the main region using keyboard shortcuts) may not work as expected.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Users may struggle to understand where core content begins if structural cues are inconsistent.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate <code>main</code> landmarks:

1. Locate the inappropriately placed <code>main</code> landmark.
2. Remove it from within the landmark in which it is nested.
