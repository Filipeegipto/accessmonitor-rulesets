# Inappropriately Unhidden Decorative Elements Check

## Description

The "Inappropriately Unhidden Decorative Elements Check" evaluates whether any purely decorative elements (e.g., icons, background SVGs, spacer images) is not hidden from assistive technologies (AT) like screen readers.

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> element marked as decorative that is exposed to Assistive Technologies.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may announce meaningless info like “image” or “graphic,” disrupting the user's experience and increasing cognitive load.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users relying on keyboard or voice control will need to tab through or hear content that has no purpose, slowing down navigation.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Users with cognitive disabilities may become confused by unnecessary auditory information that doesn’t match visible or expected context.

## Fixes

To address decorative elements that are incorrectly unhidden from assistive technologies:

1. Locate the incorrectly unhidden elements.
2. If it is an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, empty the alternative text to ensure screen readers skip the image, and add <code>role="presentation"</code> to reinforce the intention.
3. If it is an svg or an icon, add <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> to hide the element from AT, and <code>focusable="false"</code> to ensure it doesn’t appear in the tab order.
4. Elsewhere, add <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>.
