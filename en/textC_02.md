# Inappropriate Text Color Contrast Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Text Color Contrast Check" evaluates whether there is any foreground / background text color combination on the page that does not meet the enhanced contrast thresholds.

## Example outcome

I located <mark>1</mark> color combination for which the contrast ratio is lower than the optimized contrast ratio suggested by the WCAG, which is 4.5 to 1 for larger font text and 7 to 1 for regular font text.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Hard-to-read text or instructions, especially with gray-on-white or pale color combinations.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Visual fatigue leads to slower reading and lower comprehension.
- **Color Blindness:** Users with color blind deficiencies may not see sufficient contrast.
- **Elderly:** Natural aging reduces contrast sensitivity, especially in dim or backlit conditions.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate text and background color contrast ratio:

1. Locate the inappropriate text.
2. Update the color of the element to enhance the contrast against the background.
