# Scrollable Element Check

## Description

The "Scrollable Element Check" evaluates whether all scrollable elements on the page are accessible via the keyboard.

## Example outcome

I noticed that <mark>all</mark> scrollable elements are keyboard accessible.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen reader users rely on keyboard navigation to interact with content. If scrollable areas can’t be accessed, important content may be hidden.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users with limited or no ability to use a mouse can't access content if it’s not reachable via keyboard.

## Fixes

To address scrollable elements that are not keyboard accessible:

1. Locate the inappropriate scrollable element.
2. Ensure it is keyboard focusable (i.e., use <code>tabindex="0"</code> if it is not naturally focusable).
3. If possible, use a native HTML element that is naturally focuable and scrollable.
