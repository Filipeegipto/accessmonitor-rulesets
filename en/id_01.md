# Id Attributes Check

## Description

The "Id Attributes Check" evaluates whether all <code>id</code> attributes are unique.

## Example outcome

I noticed that there are <mark>no</mark> <code>id</code> attributes repeated on this webpage.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may misidentify labels or headings.
- **Motor Impairments:** Broken skip links or modals may prevent keyboard users from navigating.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Mismatched or incorrect landmarks increase confusion.

## Fixes

To address inappropriately repeated <code>id</code> attributes:

1. Locate the different elements with the same <code>id</code>.
2. Change them in order to ensure that each element has a unique <code>id</code>.
