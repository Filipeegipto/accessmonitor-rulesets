# Identical Links - Equal Destination Check

## Description

The "Identical Links - Equal Destination Check" evaluates whether groups of links with the same accessible name and context (i.e., surrounding content) lead to the same target (URL or destination).

## Example outcome

I noticed that <mark>all groups</mark> of links with the same accessible name and context have the same target.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen reader users might hear “Learn more” several times but get different results each time, leading to disorientation or loss of context. They often scan through a list of links using shortcut keys; inconsistencies break this navigation flow.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users with motor impairments often rely on predictable navigation to minimize movement or keyboard use. Inconsistencies cause repeated effort or mistakes.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Users who rely on patterns to understand and navigate content (e.g., people with autism, ADHD, or memory-related conditions) may get confused or misled. It increases cognitive load by requiring users to guess or re-learn what a repeated label means each time.

## Fixes

To address inadequate identical links:

1. Identify the links with the same accessible name but different destination or same destination but different accessible name.
2. Ensure consistency across links with the same destination.
3. Use different accessible names for links with different destinations.
