# Inappropriate Scrollable Element Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Scrollable Element Check" evaluates whether there is any scrollable container on the page that is not accessible via keyboard navigation.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> scrollable element that is not keyboard accessible.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen reader users cannot navigate to or explore scrollable content if itâ€™s not keyboard accessible, potentially missing key information.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users who cannot use a mouse (e.g., due to paralysis or amputation) cannot scroll through hidden content using keyboard-only.

## Fixes

To address scrollable elements that are not keyboard accessible:

1. Locate the inappropriate scrollable element.
2. Ensure it is keyboard focusable (i.e., use <code>tabindex="0"</code> if it is not naturally focusable).
3. If possible, use a native HTML element that is naturally focuable and scrollable.
