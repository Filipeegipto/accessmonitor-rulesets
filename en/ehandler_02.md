# Missing Redundant Event Handlers Check

## Description

The "Missing Redundant Event Handlers Check" evaluates whether there is any interactive element with a mouse event handler (like <code>onclick</code>) that does not include the corresponding keyboard event handler (like <code>onkeypress</code>, <code>onkeydown</code>, or <code>onkeyup</code>).

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> instance where redundant event handlers are not used.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Many screen reader users navigate via keyboard. If they canâ€™t trigger mouse-bound actions with the keyboard, they will be locked out of parts of the site.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users who cannot use a mouse (e.g., due to tremors, paralysis, or limb amputation) and rely on keyboards or assistive tech like switch devices will be unable to activate functionality that's mouse-only.

## Fixes

To address missing redundant event handlers:

1. Locate the element that can be triggered by a mouse event but can't be triggered by a keyboard event.
2. Add an attribute (e.g., <code>onkeydown</code>) to allow the triggering with a keyboard event.
3. If applicable, use a semantic HTML button instead which has built-in keyboard accessibility.
