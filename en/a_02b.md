# Multiple Skip Navigation Links Check

## Description

The "Multiple Skip Navigation Links Check" evaluates whether the first link on the webpage provides users with a clear and accessible option to skip directly to the main content of the page.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> link to skip content blocks.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** For users using screen readers, the existence of only one skip link may help, but it may not fully alleviate the frustration of navigating through all elements (such as menus or sidebars). A lack of multiple skip links or clear focus points can still lead to inefficiency in navigating the page.
- **Motor Impairments:** Keyboard users may benefit from a single skip link, but if the page contains multiple sections that are repetitive (e.g., multiple navigation bars or side menus), a single skip link may not suffice to improve navigation. They might still have to tab through many elements before reaching the main content.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Cognitive disabilities can make it difficult for users to process long sections of navigation. While a skip link helps, failing to have multiple skip points (or ensuring that the skip link is clearly visible or focusable) might still cause confusion or frustration.

## Fixes

To address missing or inadequate links to content:

1. Add a skip link as a focusable element on the page.
2. Ensure the target exists.
3. Make sure it's keyboard-accessible and visible (at least) when focused.
