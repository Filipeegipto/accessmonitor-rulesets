# Link Elements Check

## Description

The "Link Elements Check" evaluates whether all relevant <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements are in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and provide additional navigational context for assistive technologies and user agents (e.g., <code>rel="next"</code>, <code>rel="prev"</code>, <code>rel="index"</code>, <code>rel="contents"</code>).

## Example outcome

I located <mark>all</mark> <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements that could serve to build a navigation system.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** People with visual impairments may miss context about the documentâ€™s position within a larger system (like paginated content, wizards, or multi-step processes).
- **Motor Impairments:** Users with motor impairments can't benefit from browser-native navigation aids based on these <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> relationships.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Lack of orientation can lead to confusion, especially in large, multi-page documents or applications.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements:

1. Locate the inappropriate <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element.
2. Make sure it reflects the actual structure of the site, not just arbitrary navigation.
3. Make sure it is inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> region.
4. Provide an appropriate <code>rel</code>, according to its destination.
5. Ensure that the <code>href</code> attribute value is valid.
