# Inadequate Adjacent Links Check

## Description

The "Inadequate Adjacent Links Check" evaluates whether there are sets of adjacent anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) elements that link to the exact same destination (e.g., <code>href="/"</code>).

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> set of adjacent links pointing to the same destination.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers will read each link individually, so two identical adjacent links (e.g., an image and a text link both going to the same place) will be announced twice. This redundancy leads to frustration and cognitive overload without offering additional value.
- **Motor Impairments:** Keyboard and switch users must navigate through each link individually, so adjacent duplicates create extra, unnecessary tab stops.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Repetition of navigation elements can be confusing as users may think each link serves a different purpose. Additionally, inconsistent structure can cause disorientation.

## Fixes

To address inadequate adjacent links:

1. Identify the links that point to the same destination.
2. If an image and text are both links to the same place, wrap both in a single anchor element.
3. If theyâ€™re both text, combine or remove the redundant link. Only one is needed.
