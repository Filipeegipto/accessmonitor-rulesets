# Blinking Content Check

## Description

The "Blinking Content Check" evaluates whether there is any blinking visual effects, caused by the deprecated <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> HTML tag or the CSS code <code>text-decoration: blink</code>.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> value in the CSS which causes the blinking of parts of the content.

## Impact

- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Blinking distracts from comprehension, making the experience mentally taxing or confusing for people with cognitive disabilities.
- **ADHD/Attention-Related Disorders:** Blinking draws visual focus away from primary content. Persistent animation can make it difficult to concentrate or read surrounding content.
- **Autism/Sensory Processig Disorders:** Rapid or unexpected visual changes can be overwhelming or cause sensory discomfort. It can trigger anxiety or a strong adverse reaction.
- **Seizure Disorders:** Blinking or flashing content, even at low frequencies, can pose a risk to users with seizure disorders if it crosses thresholds. Even at sub-threshold frequencies, blinking can cause discomfort or anxiety.

## Fixes

To address blinking content:

1. Locate any <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tags.
2. Remove them.
3. Locate any <code>text-decoration: blink</code> in CSS.
4. Remove or replace the code.
5. If animation is necessary, use subtle transitions and provide a mechanism to pause or stop the animation.
