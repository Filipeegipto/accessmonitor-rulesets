# Inappropriate Presentational Role Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Presentational Role Check" evaluates whether there is any element with a presentational role (e.g., <code>role="presentation"</code> or <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>) containing a focusable content.

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> element with presentation children that has focusable content.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Assistive tech may skip the presentational container but then unexpectedly encounter focusable items inside it, creating a disjointed or broken experience. Focusable children may appear “out of context” or with no meaningful parent or label.
- **Motor Impairments:** The keyboard may tab into elements that don’t appear to have any function or context visually or semantically.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Unexpected behavior when navigating can cause disorientation or cognitive overload, especially in complex layouts.

## Fixes

To address children elements with focusable content inside a container with a presentational role:

1. Locate the focusable element.
2. Remove the element from the presentational container.
3. If it must be inside the container, remove or replace the presentational role from the container.
