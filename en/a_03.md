# Missing Image Link Alternative Text Check

## Description

The "Missing Image Link Alternative Text Check" evaluates whether there are anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) elements that contain only an image where that image has an empty alt attribute (e.g., <code>alt=""</code>)

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> link with empty content. In fact, it is composed only by an image and that image has as an empty alternative text equivalent (i.e. <code>alt=ʺʺ</code>).

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers rely on alt text to announce the purpose of the link. With no alt text, users hear nothing or just “link,” which is meaningless.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Users with cognitive disabilities using text-to-speech or simplified browsing tools will also miss the link’s purpose, leading to confusion.

## Fixes

To address missing alt text on an image link:

1. Identify the image lacking alt text.
2. Determine a meaningful alternative text.
3. Add alt text to the image using descriptive language, ensuring it accurately represents the image's purpose.
