# Inappropriate Word Spacing Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Word Spacing Check" evaluates whether there is any element that explicitly prevents the user from increasing word spacing due to its style.

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> element whose style prevent increasing word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Blocking spacing adjustments can reduce legibility and tracking across lines for users with visual impairments.
- **Cognitive Disabilities/Dyslexia:** Users who rely on adjusted word spacing to reduce cognitive load may struggle to read the content.
- **Autism:** Unchangeable dense text may overwhelm or distract users needing more visual spacing.
- **Neurological Disorders:** May experience increased reading fatigue and reduced comprehension.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate word spacing:

1. Locate the inappropriate style code.
2. Refactor it ensuring does not prevent the user from overriding word spacing.
