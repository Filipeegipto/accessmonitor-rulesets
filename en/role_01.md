# Role Value Check

## Description

The "Role Value Check" evaluates whether all HTML elements using the <code>role</code> attribute contains a valid ARIA role, as defined by the WAI-ARIA specification.

## Example outcome

I observed that <mark>all</mark> <code>role</code> attributes have valid values.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Invalid roles may be ignored by assistive technologies, making content or controls invisible or misidentified.
- **Motor Impairments:** Individuals with motor imparments may lose meaningful navigation if landmark roles (e.g., <code>banner</code>, <code>main</code>) are invalid.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Misuse may result in missing context for content or controls.

## Fixes

To address <code>role</code> attributes with invalid values:

1. Locate the element where the <code>role</code> attribute has an invalid value.
2. Replace its value with a valid one that suits its purpose, according to WAI-ARIA's specification.
