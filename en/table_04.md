# Inappropriate Nested Table Element Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Nested Table Element Check" evaluates whether any a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element inside another <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> table inside another table.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may not accurately announce relationships between rows and columns in nested structures. Navigation within deeply nested structures can become unpredictable and non-linear.
- **Motor Impairments:** Nested tables often create inconsistent focus order. Keyboard users may face erratic tabbing or reading sequences.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** The visual complexity of nested tables can make it hard to understand or mentally model the data relationships. Nested layouts often lack consistent visual cues, increasing cognitive load and frustration.

## Fixes

To address <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements nested inside other <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements:

1. Locate the inapprorpriate <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements.
2. Replace one of them by appropriate and valid HTML elements to create the same visual appearance.
