# Inappropriate Orientation Restriction Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Orientation Restriction Check" evaluates whether there is any CSS that restricts the page or its content to a specific display orientation (i.e., portrait or landscape). 

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> element with CSS properties that restrict its orientation.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Some screen magnifiers function better in a specific orientation.
- **Motor Impairments:** People with motor impairments may use devices mounted in a fixed orientation (e.g., wheelchair, hospital bed).

## Fixes

To address elements with CSS properties inappropriately restricting its orientation:

1. Locate the CSS code that restricts the orientation.
2. Remove the orientation restrictive CSS properties.
