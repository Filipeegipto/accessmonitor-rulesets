# Inappropriate Font Size Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Font Size Check" evaluates whether there is any CSS declaration where an absolute unit (like <code>px</code>, <code>pt</code>, <code>cm</code>, or <code>in</code>) are used to set font sizes.

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> instance where the font size is expressed in absolute measurement units.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Users with visual impairments may need to increase text size to read comfortably. Absolute units don't scale well with browser zoom or user stylesheets.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Being unable to enlarge text means reduced readability, especially when line spacing, font style, and size are not adaptable, presenting challenges for users with cognitive disabilities.
- **Elderly:** Age-related vision issues often require larger or adjustable text. Absolute units restrict user control.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate font size declarations:

1. Locate the CSS code where the font size is expressed using absolute units.
2. Replace the absolute units by either relative units (e.g., <code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, or <code>%</code>) or viewport-based units (e.g., <code>vw</code>, <code>vh</code>)
