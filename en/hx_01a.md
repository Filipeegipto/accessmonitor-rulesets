# Missing Headings Check

## Description

The "Missing Headings Check" evaluates whether the page contains at least one semantic heading (e.g., <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>).

## Example outcome

I noticed that this page <mark>has no</mark> headings.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Users rely on screen readers to announce headings as navigation landmarks. Missing headings means more effort to scan or jump between content sections.
- **Motor Impairments:** Keyboard-only users often rely on heading navigation (e.g., using keyboard shortcuts to jump to next/previous heading).
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Clear headings provide cues that help users understand page hierarchy and flow, reducing cognitive overload.
- **Neurodivergent Disorders:** Structured headings support focus and reduce confusion for users with ADHD or autism.

## Fixes

To address missing headings:

1. Add a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading with the main title of the page.
2. Add other headings, from <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> to denote sub-sections in a logical, hierarchical manner.
