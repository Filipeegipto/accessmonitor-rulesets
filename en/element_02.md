# ARIA Hidden Focusable Content Check

## Description

The "ARIA Hidden Focusable Content Check" evaluates whether all elements with <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> contain focusable or interactive content, such as buttons, links, or inputs.

## Example outcome

I haven't found any elements with the aria-hidden attribute that have focusable content.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** A user may tab into a button or link that screen readers don’t announce, leaving them stuck or unaware of what’s happening.
- **Motor Impairments:** People with motor impairments could land on a control that seems broken or unresponsive.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Inconsistent or "ghost" interactions (that appear but aren’t announced) can confuse and frustrate.

## Fixes

To address inappropriately focusable hidden content:

1. Locate the element that contains <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>.
2. If that's appropriate, remove focusable children from hidden containers.
3. If the children element(s) are interactable, remove the <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> attribute.
4. Finally, is most suitable, you can also disable the focusable element while it is hidden from assistive tech.
