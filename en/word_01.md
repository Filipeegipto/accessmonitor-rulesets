# Word Spacing Check

## Description

The "Word Spacing Check" evaluates whether the used CSS styles or code do not prevent users from adjusting word spacing to improve text readability.

## Example outcome

I observed that styles are not used to prevent increasing word spacing.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Enhanced spacing helps in distinguishing words. Inaccessible styles reduce legibility.
- **Cognitive Disabilities/Dyslexia:** Users may need to increase spacing to parse text more easily. Blocking this can reduce comprehension.
- **Autism:** Unchangeable dense text may overwhelm or distract users needing more visual spacing.
- **Neurological Disorders:** Custom spacing helps with sensory processing - if blocked, reading becomes difficult.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate word spacing:

1. Locate the inappropriate style code.
2. Refactor it ensuring does not prevent the user from overriding word spacing.
