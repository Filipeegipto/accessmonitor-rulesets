# Inadequate Link Title Check

## Description

The "Inadequate Link Title Check" evaluates whether the title attribute of a link (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element) provides additional or meaningful information beyond the visible link text.

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> case in which the <code>title</code> attribute of the link element only repeats the text that exists in the link.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Redundant titles can clutter the auditory experience, especially if read out alongside the link text. Some screen readers, used by users with visual impairments, read both the link text and the title, leading to confusion or frustration when both are the same.
- **Motor Impairments:** Tooltips (generated from title attributes) are not accessible via keyboard, so if important context is only in the title, it could be missed entirely by users with motor impairments.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Repetition without added value can increase cognitive load. Users may expect the title to clarify or expand on the purpose of the link - if it doesn't, it can break their expectations.

## Fixes

To address inadequate link title:

1. Evaluate whether the title attribute can provide meaningful information.
2. Remove the title attribute if it does not provide additional or meaningful information beyond the visible link text.
3. Rewrite the title attribute to provide additional, meaningful context if applicable.
