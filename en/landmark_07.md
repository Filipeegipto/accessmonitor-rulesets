# Main Landmark Check

## Description

The "Main Landmark Check" evaluates whether the <code>main</code> landmark (which identifies the primary content of a webpage) is not nested within another landmark region.

## Example outcome

I noticed that the <code>main</code> landmarks <mark>are not</mark> contained within other landmarks.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may not identify the main content properly, making page navigation inefficient or misleading.
- **Motor Impairments:** Keyboard-only users who rely on landmark navigation may not be able to quickly jump to the main content.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Unclear structure makes it harder to understand where the primary content begins and ends.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate <code>main</code> landmarks:

1. Locate the inappropriately placed <code>main</code> landmark.
2. Remove it from within the landmark in which it is nested.
