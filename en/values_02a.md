# Inappropriate Container Measurements Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Container Measurements Check" evaluates whether there is any usage of absolute measurement units in CSS styles that define the width of content boxes.

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> instance in the CSS where an absolute measurement unit is used to define the width of content boxes.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Zooming can cause overflow, truncation, or unreadable layouts.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Poor layout scaling can introduce distractions or cause confusion.
- **Elderly:** Elder people often rely on increased zoom and may struggle with layouts that donâ€™t scale.
- **Mobile:** Fixed widths break responsive design, which impairs usability for mobile users.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate content boxes width defined using absolute units:

1. Locate the inappropriate CSS.
2. Replace the absolute measurement unit with a relative one.
