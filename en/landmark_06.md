# Inappropriate Contentinfo Landmark Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Contentinfo Landmark Check" evaluates whether there is any <code>contentinfo</code> landmark nested within another region's landmark.

## Example outcome

I noticed that the <code>contentinfo</code> landmark <mark>is</mark> contained within other landmark.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may miss or misidentify the contentinfo region, making it harder to access legal, privacy, or support information.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users who depend on landmark-based keyboard shortcuts might not be able to reach the footer efficiently.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Structural inconsistencies can create confusion, particularly for users who rely on consistent patterns to navigate and comprehend layout.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate <code>contentinfo</code> landmarks:

1. Locate the inappropriately placed <code>contentinfo</code> landmark.
2. Remove it from within the landmark in which it is nested, tipically placing it on the bottom of the page.
