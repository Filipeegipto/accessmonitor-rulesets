# Orientation Restriction Check

## Description

The "Orientation Restriction Check" evaluates whether all CSS does not restrict the page or its content to a specific display orientation (i.e., portrait or landscape). 

## Example outcome

I noticed that the orientation of the elements in this page <mark>is not</mark> restricted through CSS properties.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen magnifiers may work better in specific orientations.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users with motor impairments may rely on fixed mounts (wheelchairs, assistive stands) that lock orientation.

## Fixes

To address elements with CSS properties inappropriately restricting its orientation:

1. Locate the CSS code that restricts the orientation.
2. Remove the orientation restrictive CSS properties.
