# Duplicate Main Landmark Check

## Description

The "Duplicate Main Landmark Check" evaluates whether there is more than one <code>main</code> landmark.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>2</mark> main landmarks.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may announce multiple <code>main</code> landmarks, confusing the user and making navigation harder.
- **Motor Impairments:** Keyboard navigation might become more cumbersome as users may need to skip over redundant <code>main</code> landmarks, leading to a less efficient browsing experience.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** The page structure may be unclear, leading to difficulty in identifying the main content or distinguishing it from other sections.

## Fixes

To address multiple <code>main</code> landmarks:

1. Locate the different <code>main</code> landmarks.
2. Remove the ones that aren't correctly assigned, moving the content to the correct one if necessary.
