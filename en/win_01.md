# Inappropriate Pop-Up Windows Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Pop-Up Windows Check" evaluates whether a webpage opens one or more new windows (e.g., via <code>window.open()</code>) automatically when the page loads, without user interaction.

## Example outcome

I found that this webpage has pop-up windows.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Users relying on screen readers may not realize a new window has opened, or may lose track of where they are.
- **Motor Impairments:** Pop-up windows can be challenging if individuals with motor impairments struggle to quickly switch between windows or dismiss pop-ups.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** People with cognitive disabilities may face confusion, disorientation, or anxiety due to unexpected context changes.
- **Attention Disorders:** Sudden new content may break concentration or trigger cognitive overload.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate pop-up windows:

1. Locate the element that causes the automatic opening of pop-up windows.
2. Replace it with a triggerable element so users can manually open the new window(s).
