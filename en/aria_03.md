# ARIA State and Property Value Check

## Description

The "ARIA State and Property Value Check" evaluates whether all ARIA states and properties used in the page contain values that conform to the value types defined in the ARIA specification.

## Example outcome

I noticed that all ARIA states and properties have a valid value type.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Invalid ARIA values are ignored or misinterpreted, so interactive elements may not be announced or acted upon correctly (e.g., <code>aria-expanded="yes"</code> instead of "true" or "false"). Screen readers may ignore them entirely.
- **Motor Impairments:** If roles like switch, checkbox, or button donâ€™t reflect their correct state (because the value is invalid), it leads to broken interaction patterns, affecting people with motor impairments.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Relying on ARIA to clarify structure and functionality, users with cognitive disabilities may miss cues that should aid orientation or understanding.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate aria state and property values:

1. Identify the incorrect ARIA attribute.
2. Look up the attribute in the ARIA specification to understand its required value type.
3. Update the value to match the correct format (e.g., true/false, ID reference, number, or specific token).
