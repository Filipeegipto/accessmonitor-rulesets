# Inappropriate Letter Spacing Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Letter Spacing Check" evaluates whether there is any content containing styling code that prevents users from adjusting text spacing, particularly letter spacing.

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> element whose style prevent increasing letter spacing to at least 0.12 times the font size.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Individuals with visual impairments rely on extra spacing to clearly distinguish between letters and words.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Readability is significantly improved by increasing spacing, helping reduce mental fatigue.
- **Dyslexia:** They may struggle with tightly spaced text due to visual crowding, which can lead to skipping words or misreading.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate letter spacing:

1. Locate the style code used to inappropriately forbid increasing letter spacing.
2. Remove or change the code, ensuring that it allows the increase of letter spacing.
