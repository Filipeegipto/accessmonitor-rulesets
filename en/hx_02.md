# Inappropriate Heading Content Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Heading Content Check" evaluates whether any heading element does not provide a meaningful, descriptive content.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> heading whose content is only composed by an image without the <code>alt</code> attribute, i.e. without any textual equivalent alternative.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers cannot announce the heading’s purpose if the image lacks alt text—making that section a mystery.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users navigating via keyboard or assistive devices rely on headings to skip between sections—they can't effectively do this if headings are invisible to them.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Icons or images without accompanying text can confuse users who rely on clear cues for navigation.
- **Neurodivergent Disorders:** Headings support cognitive organization. A non-descriptive image heading disrupts understanding and focus.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate heading content:

1. Locate the heading inappropriately defined.
2. If it is only composed by an image, include a meaningful <code>alt</code> text.
3. When possible, use text inside headings and opt whether to include a decorative image.
4. If applicable, make sure to use a meaningful and concise heading text.
