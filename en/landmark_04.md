# Inappropriate Complementary Landmarks Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Complementary Landmarks Check" evaluates whether there is any <code>complementary</code> landmark nested within another region's landmark.

## Example outcome

I noticed that the <code>complementary</code> landmark <mark>is</mark> contained within other landmark.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may not recognize or expose the complementary region, or they may misrepresent its relationship to the main content.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users who depend on keyboard shortcuts to jump between landmark regions may not be able to access the complementary section efficiently.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Page layout may seem illogical or inconsistent, especially if multiple sections are indistinct or repeated.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate <code>complementary</code> landmarks:

1. Locate the inappropriately placed <code>complementary</code> landmark.
2. Remove it from within the landmark in which it is nested.
