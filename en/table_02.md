# Missing Data Table Caption Check

## Description

The "Missing Data Table Caption Check" evaluates whether there is any  data table withou a <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> element to describe the purpose or content of the table.

## Example outcome

I located <mark>1</mark> data table without the <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> element.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers will not announce what the table is about unless a caption or an alternative mechanism is provided. This can make the data meaningless or confusing in isolation.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Users with cognitive disabilities benefit from extra cues to understand structure and purpose. Captions serve as a simple, consistent way to provide that context.
- **ADHD/Memory Disorders:** A caption serves as an anchor to help ADHD / memory users remember what theyâ€™re looking at while navigating the table.

## Fixes

To address data tables without a <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> element:

1. Locate the data table.
2. Add a <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> element to it, describing concisely what the table contains.
3. Place the <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> tag immediately after the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> opening tag.
