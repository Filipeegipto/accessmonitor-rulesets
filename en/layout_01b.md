# Inappropriate Obselete Elements For Visual Presentation Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Obselete Elements For Visual Presentation Check" evaluates whether there is any obselete element used to control page presentation.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> obsolete element used to control the visual presentation.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers rely on semantic structure to interpret the document. If <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> is used purely for layout, it may be read as a data table, confusing the user.
- **Motor Impairments:** Obsolete structures often lack keyboard navigability or logical tab order. CSS-based layouts are more predictable and navigable for alternative input devices.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Layout inconsistencies and lack of logical structure can increase cognitive load. Non-semantic structures can interfere with reading comprehension tools.

## Fixes

To address obselete elements inappropriately used to control visual presentation:

1. Locate the inappropriate obselete elements.
2. Remove the element from the HTML code.
3. Add semantic HTML elements and CSS code to create the same visual appearance.
