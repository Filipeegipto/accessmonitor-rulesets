# Complementary Landmarks Check

## Description

The "Complementary Landmarks Check" evaluates whether all the <code>complementary</code> landmarks are not nested within other landmarks.

## Example outcome

I noticed that the <code>complementary</code> landmarks <mark>are not</mark> contained within other landmarks.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may not announce or provide access to complementary regions, especially if nested inside the <code>main</code> or <code>article</code> landmarks.
- **Motor Impairments:** Navigating directly to complementary content (e.g., via keyboard shortcuts or ARIA landmark navigation) might become impossible if improperly nested.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Inconsistencies in page layout can lead to misunderstanding the structure or purpose of side content.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate <code>complementary</code> landmarks:

1. Locate the inappropriately placed <code>complementary</code> landmark.
2. Remove it from within the landmark in which it is nested.
