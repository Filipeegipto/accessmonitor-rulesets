# ARIA Role Check

## Description

The "ARIA Role Check" evaluates whether all elements using ARIA roles are placed in the correct semantic context.

## Example outcome

I noticed that <mark>all elements</mark> with an explicit semantic role exist inside their required contexts.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Improper role nesting can confuse screen readers or prevent them from correctly interpreting the page structure. For example, a menuitem outside of a menu context might not behave as expected.
- **Motor Impairments:** Some roles (like menuitem, tab, etc.) come with expected keyboard interactions. If they're out of context, these interactions might break or behave inconsistently.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Misleading semantic structures can disrupt the user's mental model of the interface, making navigation and comprehension more difficult.

## Fixes

To address inapropriate or missing ARIA roles:

1. Identify the element with the inapropriate or missing ARIA role.
2. Check the ARIA specification for valid parent or ancestor roles required by that role (e.g., a menuitem must be inside a menu, menubar, or group).
3. Correct the hierarchy by placing the role-bearing element within the required context.
