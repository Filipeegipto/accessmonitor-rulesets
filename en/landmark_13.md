# Singular Main Landmark Check

## Description

The "Singular Main Landmark Check" evaluates whether there is only one <code>main</code> landmark.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>one</mark> main landmark.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may announce multiple <code>main</code> landmarks, leading to confusion about which content is primary.
- **Motor Impairments:** Navigating through multiple <code>main</code> landmarks could result in longer navigation times, complicating the user experience.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** The redundancy may cause confusion, making it harder for users to focus on the primary content of the page.

## Fixes

To address multiple <code>main</code> landmarks:

1. Locate the different <code>main</code> landmarks.
2. Remove the ones that aren't correctly assigned, moving the content to the correct one if necessary.
