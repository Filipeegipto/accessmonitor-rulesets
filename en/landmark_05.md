# Contentinfo Landmark Check

## Description

The "Contentinfo Landmark Check" evaluates whether the <code>contentinfo</code> landmark (typically representing a site's footer or metadata) is not nested within other landmark regions.

## Example outcome

I noticed that the <code>contentinfo</code> landmarks <mark>are not</mark> contained within other landmarks.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen reader users might not be able to locate the footer or understand its relation to the rest of the content.
- **Motor Impairments:** Inefficient or blocked keyboard landmark navigation can make reaching the footer difficult.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Poor structure can impair the ability to predict or recognize site-wide patterns.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate <code>contentinfo</code> landmarks:

1. Locate the inappropriately placed <code>contentinfo</code> landmark.
2. Remove it from within the landmark in which it is nested, tipically placing it on the bottom of the page.
