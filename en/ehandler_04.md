# Inappropriate Event Handlers Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Event Handlers Check" evaluates whether there is any event handler on elements that are not inherently interactive (e.g., <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>).

## Example outcome

I identified <mark>1</mark> instance where event handlers are associated with non-interactive elements.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Relying on screen readers, these users cannot detect that a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> has interactive behavior unless it's correctly marked up.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users who navigate using a keyboard won't be able to interact with elements that aren't focusable (<code>tabindex="0"</code>) or that lack keyboard event support.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Inconsistent interaction patterns may confuse users who rely on predictable UI structures and behavior.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate event handlers:

1. Locate the element that is not interective but contains an event handler.
2. Replace the element by an inherently interactive, keyboard-accessible, and has the correct role element (e.g., <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>).
