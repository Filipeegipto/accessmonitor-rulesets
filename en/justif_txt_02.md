# Inappropriate CSS Justified Text Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate CSS Justified Text Check" evaluates whether there is any instance where text justification is applied using CSS rules such as <code>text-align: justify;</code>.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> instance using justified text via CSS.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Users with visual impairment may depend on consistent visual cues to track lines, and uneven spacing breaks those cues.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** People with attention, processing, or learning difficulties find it harder to scan and understand text when spacing is inconsistent.
- **Dyslexia:** Justification produces uneven spacing, causing “rivers” of white space that distort word boundaries.
- **Elderly:** Age-related reading difficulty is increased by justification-induced text distortion.

## Fixes

To address text inappropriately justified:

1. Locate the inappropriately justified block of text.
2. Replace the <code>text-align: justify;</code> styling code by <code>text-align: left;</code>.
