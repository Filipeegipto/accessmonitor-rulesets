# Inappropriate Text-Background Contrast Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Text-Background Contrast Check" evaluates whether there is any text that has insufficient contrast against its background.

## Example outcome

I located <mark>1</mark> color combination for which the contrast ratio is lower than the minimum contrast ratio allowed by the WCAG, which is 3 to 1 for larger font text and 4.5 to 1 for regular font text.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Low contrast can make text unreadable for visually impaired users.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Increased effort required to read low-contrast content may cause cognitive overload.
- **Color Blindness:** For people with color blindness, ome color combinations (e.g., red/green, blue/purple) can be indistinguishable.
- **Elderly:** Natural vision degradation makes high contrast essential.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate contrast between text and background:

1. Locate the text that doesn't have sufficient contrast against its background.
2. Update the color pair (font and background) to meet or exceed the minimum contrast ratios as per WCAG.
