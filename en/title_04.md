# Inappropriate Page Title Length Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Page Title Length Check" evaluates whether the page's <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element text is concise (i.e., not too long).

## Example outcome

It seems to me that the webpage title is too long - it contains <mark>100</mark> characters.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers announce the page title when switching between pages or navigating to a new site.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Concise titles help users orient themselves and understand the page content quickly.
- **All:** Browser tabs show the page title.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> elements:

1. Locate the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element.
2. Provide a meaningful and descriptive text, ensuring it is not longer than 65 characters.
