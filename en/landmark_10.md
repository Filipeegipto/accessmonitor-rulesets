# Duplicate Banner Landmark Check

## Description

The "Duplicate Banner Landmark Check" evaluates whether there is more than one <code>banner</code> landmark.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>2</mark> banner landmarks.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Multiple banner landmarks may lead to confusion as screen readers will read them out as "banner", which might mislead users into thinking the information is repeated.
- **Motor Impairments:** Keyboard navigation might become more cumbersome, requiring the user to navigate through multiple banners, leading to a longer time to find the actual content.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Redundant banners could create confusion about the page structure, potentially leading to difficulty in understanding the site's layout.

## Fixes

To address multiple <code>banner</code> landmarks:

1. Locate the different <code>banner</code> landmarks.
2. Remove the ones that aren't correctly assigned, moving the content to the correct one if necessary.
