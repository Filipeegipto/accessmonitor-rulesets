# Banner Landmark Check

## Description

The "Banner Landmark Check" evaluates whether the <code>banner</code> landmark (typically used for site-wide headers or branding) is placed only at the top level of the page and is not nested within other landmark regions (e.g., <code>main</code>).

## Example outcome

I noticed that the <code>banner</code> landmarks <mark>are not</mark> contained within other landmarks.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Users relying on screen readers may not be able to navigate properly or even detect the banner.
- **Motor Impairments:** Inconsistent landmark structure can hinder keyboard-only navigation.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Confusing structure can cause disorientation and navigation fatigue.

## Fixes

To address <code>banner</code> landmarks inappropriately contained within other landmarks:

1. Locate the inappropriately placed <code>banner</code> landmark.
2. Remove it from within the landmark in which it is nested, tipically placing it on top of the page.
