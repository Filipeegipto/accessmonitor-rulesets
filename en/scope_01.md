# Inappropriate Scope Attribute Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Scope Attribute Check" evaluates whether there is any element in data tables that have an invalid value for the <code>scope</code> attribute.

## Example outcome

I found that there is <mark>1</mark> case where the <code>scope</code> attribute of a data table is invalid.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Visually impaired users cannot determine which header applies to which data cell, especially in complex tables.
- **Motor Impairments:** Navigating tabular data may be confusing or context-less without proper scoping.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Misinterpreting or misunderstanding data relationships due to lack of structure.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate <code>scope</code> attributes:

1. Locate the element with an invalid <code>scope</code> attribute.
2. Replace its value by a valid one (e.g., <code>row</code> or <code>col</code>).
