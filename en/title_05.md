# Inappropriate Page Title Characters Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Page Title Characters Check" evaluates whether the page <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element avoids using ASCII art, character patterns, or decorative text that may interfere with readability or comprehension.

## Example outcome

I found that the webpage title has <mark>2</mark> characters next to each other that seems like ASCII-Art.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Symbols may be read out literally or incorrectly, reducing clarity or usability. Decorative or patterned characters can make it harder to skim and identify content.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** ASCII art or symbols can cause confusion, misinterpretation, or cognitive overload.
- **ADHD/Autism:** Non-standard characters may reduce focus or impair understanding of page context.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> elements:

1. Locate the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element.
2. Ensure it contains plain, descriptive text that clearly states the pageâ€™s purpose. Avoid symbols, repeated punctuation, or decorative patterns.
