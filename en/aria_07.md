# ARIA Attributes Check

## Description

The "ARIA Attributes Check" evaluates whether all aria-* attributes used in the HTML are valid and defined in the official ARIA specification.

## Example outcome

I noticed that <mark>all</mark> aria-* attributes are defined in the ARIA specfication.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** People with visual impairments might not receive necessary information about roles, states, or properties of elements.
- **Motor Impairments:** Interactive elements may not behave as expected or appear in the tab order incorrectly.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Inconsistent behavior of components may cause confusion, affecting users with cognitive disabilities.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate ARIA attributes:

1. Locate the invalid ARIA attributes.
2. Use the ARIA specification to verify the valid attributes.
3. Replace the invalid attributes with valid ones, or remove them if unnecessary.
